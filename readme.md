Audio Viz
=========

### Motivation

Pretty lights get me high, and Processing is a fun language.

### Goals

Create a full-screen animation, suitable for a projector, which responds and adapts to whatever music is playing. The user has high-level control, but mostly want it to be a set-it-and-forget-it cool thing.

### Code

Developed in Processing 3.0, using the Minim audio library.

### Current Output

Allows the user to play any (open-supported) music file located in the same directory as the project. Current effects: planet (p), rings (r), stars (s), waveforms (j), dandruff (d). Next and previous track with arrow keys.
